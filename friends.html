    <p><b>HYPOTHESIS</b></p>
    <p>Modern social media platforms are increasingly saturated with content from unfamiliar accounts, inundating users with highly curated portrayals of influencers and creators. These posts often emphasise only the most polished and idealised aspects of their lives, creating a distorted representation of reality.</p>
    <p><b>THEORY</b></p>
    <p>Friends seeks to restore social media’s original purpose — genuine connection with friends. Users see content exclusively from their friends, with no publicly visible follower or following counts.</p>
    
    <img src="Friends2.png" alt="Image of Friends app prototype" class="img-rectangle-height">
    <p>The platform features a clean and simple interface, requiring you to enter each friend's space to view and engage with their content. This design prevents overwhelming feeds and ensures that every interaction is more deliberate and meaningful.</p>
    <p>Contrary to a traditional wall layout, each person’s space is designed as a board — a flexible canvas where users can freely arrange their photos and content. The canvas can be themed from retro to pastel. This approach allows for more organic storytelling, free from the constraints of a rigid grid. Life doesn’t always follow a chronological order, so why should your memories?</p>

    <p>To add friends or be added by others, you must physically scan a nametag on their device. This ensures that every connection is with someone you personally know.</p>

    <p>Instead of traditional like buttons and comments, friends interact using stickers that they can freely place on each other’s canvases. Just as we once shared messages through stickers and post-it notes as kids, this feature brings a nostalgic, playful way to connect.</p>
