              There’s something about photo apps today that feels strangely industrial and impersonal. They store our memories very efficiently,
              but they don’t really <i>hold</i> them.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              There was a time when photo albums were tangible vessels of personal history, holding the stories and emotions of ourselves and our loved ones — moments 
              carefully preserved and cherished, before they became mere files on a screen.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s the kind of feeling I want to recreate with the Recollection design. It distills the essence of a photo album into a minimalist gallery app, offering a 
              serene, focused space to revisit memories. No noise, no clutter, no complicated features getting in the way. Just a clear, quiet space to sit with the moments that matter.
            </p>
            
        <div class="mockup-container">
            <img src="Recollection2.png" alt="Recollection App Mockup">

            <p>
              Replacing rigid, impersonal typefaces is a warm, handwritten script, and replacing polished, digital icons is a set of playful, hand-drawn illustrations, reminiscent of the kind 
              of doodles a child might add to a scrapbook.
            </p>
        
        <div class="mockup-container">

        </div>    

            <p>
              The interface stays minimal on purpose. You can easily add or remove photos, organise them into albums, and share a small collection with someone else.
            </p>

              It’s not trying to be everything. It’s just trying to feel like a quiet place to remember.
