    <p><b>HYPOTHESIS</b></p>
    <p></p>Photo apps today feel industrial and impersonal, reducing our memories to mere files on a screen. There was a time when photo albums were tangible vessels of personal history, holding the stories and emotions of ourselves and our loved ones, moments carefully preserved and cherished, not just stored.</p>
    <p><b>THEORY</b></p>
    <p>Recollection reimagines the essence of a photo album as a minimalist gallery app, offering a serene, focused space to revisit memories. Each image becomes a window into a distinct moment of life, allowing users to experience their past with clarity and intimacy, free from distractions.</p>

    <p>Replacing rigid, impersonal typefaces is a warm, handwritten script, and replacing polished, digital icons is a set of playful, hand-drawn illustrations, reminiscent of the kind of doodles a child might add to a scrapbook.</p>

    <img src="Recollection3.png" alt="Image of Recollection app prototype" class="img-box-height">
    <p>A minimal interface lets users effortlessly add or remove photos from an album and share curated collections of memories with others.</p>
