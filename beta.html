    <p>I’m currently waiting to matriculate into university to study Computer Engineering.</p>

    <p>I studied at Dunman High School for six years previously under the Integrated Programme and currently serve as Vice President of its Youth Alumni.</p>

    <p>In my downtime, I naturally gravitate toward pieces on startups, tech, and design which have shaped most of my reading in recent years. I’ve gathered my standout favourites <a href="#">here [↦]</a>.</p>

    <p>Although I studied computing, I’ve steadily gravitated towards UX design, teaching myself and enjoying the quiet hours spent refining quick Figma prototypes. Whenever I can, I turn ideas into something tangible and interactive, which you can explore below:</p>
