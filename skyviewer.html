              Operating systems are what shape the way we interact with our devices. Consider how we moved from pressing tiny buttons on a 
              Nokia 3310 or a BlackBerry Classic to swiping, tapping, and pinching on a smooth glass screen. Early mobile systems like those 
              on Nokia had to prioritise efficiency due to a limited number of input methods. Then iOS arrived and changed everything. Fixed 
              buttons gave way to a more flexible, multi-touch canvas. Suddenly, the phone wasn’t just a tool following predetermined input 
              pathways; It became an adaptable surface, where gestures, swipes, and taps became the language we spoke with our devices.
            </p>

              Skyviewer is a design experiment exploring app control through BlackBerry’s capacitive gesture system. It presents a modern weather
              app, built with the interaction style once characteristic of formal BlackBerry applications.

            <p>
              In today’s world, where multi-touch has made app design effortless and intuitive, limiting interactions to purely gestures demands a 
              far more deliberate approach.

            <p>
              Every swipe and tap must be carefully considered, ensuring that essential functions are always accessible without overwhelming the 
              user with unnecessary motions. This constraint encourages a refined, purposeful UX where simplicity and efficiency must coexist seamlessly.
