    <p><b>THESIS</b></p>
    <p>Operating systems have continually reshaped the way we interact with our devices, moving from the tactile precision of physical keypads to the fluid immediacy of multitouch interfaces. Early mobile systems like those on Nokia phones or BlackBerry devices centered on efficiency through buttons. The arrival of iOS redefined this relationship, replacing fixed inputs with a dynamic, touch-driven canvas. This evolution transformed the phone from a tool with predetermined pathways into an adaptable surface where gestures, swipes, and taps became the language of interaction.</p>
    <p><b>THEORY</b></p>
    <p>Skyviewer is a design exploration that reimagines app control through BlackBerry’s capacitive gesture system. It presents a weather forecast experience built with the interaction style and user flow once characteristic of classic BlackBerry applications.</p>

    <p>In today’s world, touch has made app design effortless and intuitive, but limiting interactions to gestures demands a more deliberate approach. Every swipe and tap must be carefully considered, ensuring that essential functions are always accessible without overwhelming the user with unnecessary motions. This constraint encourages a refined, purposeful UX where simplicity and efficiency coexist seamlessly.</p>
