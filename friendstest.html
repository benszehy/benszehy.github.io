            <p>
                Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how noisy social media has become. My feed is constantly full
                of creators I’ve never met, influencers trying to show us some perfectly curated page, or worse, advertise
                some sort of service — <i>if I have to hear about the Revolut card one more time</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>This contrasts pretty starkly with what social media was originally intended for, in the times of MySpace or Friendster. 
                As the name suggests, social media was just a space for people to connect and share bits of their lives with their friends. 
                Somewhere along the way, that whole idea of sharing intimate moments with friends turned into curating your profile to show who 
                visited the most number of Michelin restaurants.
            </p>

            <p>
                These posts often emphasise only the most polished and idealised aspects of a person’s life, creating a distorted representation 
                of reality.
            </p>

            <p>FRIENDS seeks to restore social media’s original purpose — a genuine connection with friends. Users see content exclusively from their friends,
                with no publicly visible follower or following counts to compete over.
            </p>

            <p>The interface is super simple. One thing I’m really excited about is the board layout. Instead of the usual doomscrolling of an 
                endless chronological feed optimised to keep you on the app, you’re presented with all your friends. In order to see what they’ve added, 
                you enter your friend’s space, almost like stepping into their room. This design prevents overwhelming feeds and ensures that every interaction 
                is intentional.
            </p>

        </div>
                        
            <p>Each person gets a blank canvas they can arrange however they want. Instead of a rigid grid view, you can have a scrapbook, clean pastel aesthetic 
                or a chaotic collage of random moments. Memories aren’t perfectly linear, so why force them to be? This builds more of a personal consciousness for 
                each person.
